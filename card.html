            <p class="card-text">The NFLs first Super Bowl in Las Vegas was a sloppy, mistake-filled affair that was
                mostly
                boring until the back-and-forth fourth quarter and OT. It was the second of 58 Super Bowls to be tied
                after
                regulation, and the first played under new overtime rules that ensured both teams got the ball.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The number of years without a title now sits at 29, a shocking amount of time for a
                franchise that racked up five Lombardi Trophies in a 13-year span from 1981 to '94, led by some of the
                greatest players and coaches the sport has known. San Francisco is the fifth team in league history to
                lose three straight Super Bowls, a streak that follows it winning in its first five appearances in the
                big game.</p>
